# Introduction to Artificial Intelligence (AI)
Artificial Intelligence is an approach to build a machines that able to think as how human think. AI simulates human intelligence and processes by machines to find solutions for various complex problems in a similar way to humans. It includes reasoning, natural processing language and even various algorithms are used to put the intelligence in the system. In general, AI are classified into two categories:

* `Weak AI` : Weak AI, also known as "Narrow AI" is an AI system that is designed and trained to perform specific tasks only. Some examples of Weak AI including Apple Siri, IBM Watson, Alexa and Alpha Go.

* `Strong AI` : Up until now, researchers are still working on strong AI which is made up of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI). A strong AI is expected to have self-awareness and become the equivalent of human intelligence.

In this course we will learn about some algorithm and write it into code to solve a problem.
